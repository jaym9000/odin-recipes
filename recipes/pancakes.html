    <!-- Steps to make the Pancake -->
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Whisk water and baking soda together in a mixing bowl. Add ricotta
        cheese, lemon zest, vegetables oil, sugar, egg, and vanilla. Whisk until
        smooth, breaking up lumps of cheese as you mix. Add melted butter, lemon
        juice, and 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons self-rising flour. Whisk together,
        stirring until most of flour disappears into the batter.
      </li>
      <li>Let batter sit at room temperature about 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>
        Heat lightly greased cast iron skillet or griddle over medium-high heat.
        Portion out 1/4 cup scoops of batter onto skillet (cook in batches).
        When bubbles begin to form on the surface and the edges of the pancakes
        start to look dry (2 to 3 minutes), flip and cook other side until
        cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a warm plate.
