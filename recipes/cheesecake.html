    <!-- Steps to take in order to make the cheesecake -->
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch
        springform pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and sugar for crust in a
        bowl until mixture resembles wet sand. Transfer to the prepared pan. Use
        the bottom of a measuring cup to press crumbs firmly into an even layer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake crust in the preheated oven until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes.
        Remove from the oven and let sit on a wire rack until completely cool.
        Leave the oven on.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the crust is cooling, beat cream cheese in a stand mixer fitted
        with the paddle attachment on low speed until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add sugar, sour cream, and vanilla. Scrape down the bottom and sides of
        the bowl and continue to beat until combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gently whisk one egg with a fork in a small bowl; add to the cream
        cheese mixture and beat just until combined. Repeat with each remaining
        egg, whisking and adding just one at a time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the bowl from the stand mixer and firmly bang it on the counter a
        few times to release any large air bubbles.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the springform pan (with the cooled crust) in an oven bag. Fold
        down the excess and wrap the pan in a layer of heavy-duty aluminum foil.
        Pour cheesecake mixture into the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the springform pan in a large roasting pan and move it to the
        lower rack of the oven.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour 2 inches of boiling water into the roasting pan. Bake cheesecake
        until edges are puffed and surface is firm except for a small spot in
        the center that will jiggle when the pan is gently shaken, about 1 ½
        hours. Tent the cheesecake with a sheet of foil if the top is browning
        too much during baking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn off the oven; keep the oven door closed and let the cheesecake cool
        slowly for 2 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the oven. Take the springform pan out of the water bath and
        set it on a cooling rack; let sit until it comes to room temperature,
        about 2 more hours. Place in the refrigerator until fully set, 8 hours
        to overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Run the tip of a knife around the edges of the pan. Unhinge the lock and
        remove the pan sides. Use a warm, clean knife to cut every slice. Top
        slices with cherry pie filling. Keep leftovers in the refrigerator.
